# C# Code Pack: 
This is a very basic project I created - in my limited spare time - to showcase my understanding of (And ability to create and use) some fundamental C# and Computer Science concepts - which are often raised in Interviews. 
<br>
This is more a "code sample" - intended to showcase resolution of some common interview questions and code challenges - than it is a "real-world application".
<br>
</br>
All code was written from-scratch, and is separated - by topic - into folders with related code grouped within; Some parts of the code may be reused throughout the application.
<br>
</br>
I'll be taking my time to do each topic to completion, before moving on to the next - starting with some basic custom data structures and all the possible use-cases/methods they would have.
<br> 
However, this project is still a Work in Progress (WIP) - and will be for some time, as I have very limited time to focus on any personal projects.
