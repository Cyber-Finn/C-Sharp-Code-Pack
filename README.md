# C# Code Pack: 
This is a very basic project I created to showcase my understanding of (And ability to create and use) some fundamental C# and Computer Science concepts - which are often raised in Interviews. 
This is more a "code sample" - intended to showcase resolution of some common interview questions - than it is a "real-world application".

All code was written from-scratch, and is separated - by topic - into folders with related code grouped within; Some parts of the code may be reused throughout the application though.
